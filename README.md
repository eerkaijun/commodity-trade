The project is divided into four parts, which could be automated into a pipeline: 

1) Web Scraping - scrape news article and everyday prices related to the commodity we want to trade

2) Sentiment Analysis - decide whether the sentiment/outlook on the news article is positive or negative

3) Time Series Prediction - based on the sentiment and historical prices, predict the price movement of the commodity in the future

4) Reinforcement Learning - train an agent to make buying or selling decision on the commodity, managing profit and risk at the same time
